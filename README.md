# AutoOculusTouch_Gui
This Iterface maps Touch controller Buttons,A xis, and Motion Gestures to a VigemBus Xinput or DS4 emuulated device.  You can also Map headstracking to the Mouse or right joystick for the VigemBus emulated device.  

Experimental touch controller positional gesture mapping and Bhaptics is a WIP.  The files can be configured seperately and modified to work as desired, but there is no interface integration.
